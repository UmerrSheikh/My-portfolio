<p>when we describe poverty, usually we consider it in financial aspect , 
    where as it also belong to conceptual and physicic aspect of a person.
 <br>  in pakistan, when ever you encounter any situation where you have 
     to hire any labour or any one whose job is by hand they are usually so
      arrogent and doesnot put exta work or do uncomplete tasks so that the other
       person will hire them for the next day as well

     for the progress and prosperity of the nation but unfortunatily it does not 
     seem to be like that and somehow we as a nation doen not put our effort in this </p>
